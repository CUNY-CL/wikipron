"""Word and pron extraction for Latin.

As of writing (November 2019), Latin cannot use the default extraction
function, which uses the Wiktionary entry page title as the graphemes.
Latin uses the macrons orthographically (for vowel length),
but the Wiktionary entry page titles never have them.
The correct orthographic form is available from within the entry page.

In the underlying HTML, the Latin entry pages are in two different forms.

1. Because the orthographic distinction by macrons is collapsed,
   a Latin entry page organizes the "homographs" in terms of "Etymologies".
   Each etymology has its own (correct) orthographic form and pronunciations:

   <h3>
       <span class="mw-headline" id = "Etymology_1">Etymology 1</span>
   </h3>
   <p>
       <!-- The orthographic form we want. -->
       <strong class="Latn headword" lang="la">...</strong>
   </p>
   <ul>
       <!-- The pronunciation we want. -->
       <span class="IPA">...</span>
   </ul>

2. For entries that don't have "Etymology" sections, the underlying HTML
   structure is very similar, with everything moved up one level,
   from <h3> for an etymology to <h2> for Latin.

   <h2>
       <span class="mw-headline" id = "Latin">Latin</span>
   </h2>
   <p>
       <!-- The orthographic form we want. -->
       <strong class="Latn headword" lang="la">...</strong>
   </p>
   <ul>
       <!-- The pronunciation we want. -->
       <span class="IPA">...</span>
   </ul>
