"""Word and pron extraction for Latin.

As of writing (November 2019), Latin cannot use the default extraction
function because of the following:

1. The default extraction function uses the Wiktionary entry page title
   as the graphemes. Latin uses the macrons orthographically (for vowel
   length), but the Wiktionary entry page titles never have them.
2. Relatedly, because the orthographic distinction by macrons is collapsed,
   a Latin entry page organizes the "homographs" in terms of "Etymologies".
   Each etymology has its own (correct) orthographic form and pronunciations.

The solution for Latin is to go through each "Etymology" and extract the
word and pronunciation at this level.
