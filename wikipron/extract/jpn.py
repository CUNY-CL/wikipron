"""Simplified word and pron extraction for Japanese

This extraction function attempts to target Japanese orthographic entries
that are composed solely of kana. As of March 2020, the kana variant of a
headword containing kanji is generally found inside an <rt> element
that is itself contained with the <strong> element containing
the headword.

As written, this extraction function will only target one orthographic
entry on a given page and only extracts pronunciations from within the
first Pronunciation <li> it finds. This was done to avoid the complexity
of having to correctly match words to pronunciations when varying amounts
of each are given.
