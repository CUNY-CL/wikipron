WikiPron is a command line toolkit for scraping grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) data
from Wiktionary.

## Installation

WikiPron requires Python 3.6+. It is available through pip:

```bash
pip install wikipron
```

## Usage

After installation, the terminal command `wikipron` will be available.
As a basic example, the following command scrapes G2P data for French
(with the ISO language code `fr`):

```bash
wikipron fr
```

By default, the results appear on the terminal,
where each line has the orthography of a word, followed by a tab and then
the word's pronunciation in IPA.

For example commands using advanced options,
the [`languages/wikipron/scrape`](languages/wikipron/scrape) script shows
how a multilingual G2P dataset can be created.

For a full list of command-line options, please run `wikipron -h`.

The underlying module can also be used from Python.
A standard workflow looks like:

```python
import wikipron

config = wikipron.Config(key="fr")  # French, with default options.
for word, pron in wikipron.scrape(config):
    ...
```
