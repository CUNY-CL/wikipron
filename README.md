Command-line tool
-----------------

### Installation

WikiPron requires Python 3.6+. It is available through pip:

```bash
pip install wikipron
```

### Usage

#### Quick Start

After installation, the terminal command `wikipron` will be available. As a
basic example, the following command scrapes G2P data for French:

```bash
wikipron fra
```

#### Specifying the Language

The language is indicated by a three-letter [ISO
639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) or [ISO
639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes) language code,
e.g., `fra` for French. For which languages can be scraped,
[here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Terms_with_IPA_pronunciation_by_language)
is the complete list of languages on Wiktionary that have pronunciation entries.

#### Specifying the Dialect

One can optionally specify dialects to target using the `--dialect` flag. The
dialect name can be found together with the transcription on Wiktionary. For
example, "(UK, US) IPA: /təˈmɑːtəʊ/". To restrict to the union of dialects use
the pipe character '\|': e.g., `--dialect='General American | US'`.
Transcriptions which lack a dialect specification are selected regardless of the
value of this flag.

#### Segmentation

By default, the [`segments`](https://github.com/cldf/segments) library is used
to segment the transcription into whitespace. The segmentation tends to place
IPA diacritics and modifiers on the "parent" symbol. For instance, \[kʰæt\] is
rendered `kʰ æ t`. This can be disabled using the `--no-segment` flag.

#### Parentheses 

Some of transcriptions contain parentheses to indicate alternative pronunciations.
The parentheses (but not the content) are discarded in the scrape unless the 
`--no-skip-parens` flag is used.

#### Output

The scraped data is organized with each \<word, pronunciation\> pair on its own
line, where the word and pronunciation are separated by a tab. Note that the
pronunciation is in [International Phonetic Alphabet
(IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), segmented
by spaces that correctly handle the combining and modifier diacritics for
modeling purposes, e.g., we have `kʰ æ t` with the aspirated k instead of
`k ʰ æ t`.

For illustration, here is a snippet of French data scraped by WikiPron:

```tsv
accrémentitielle    a k ʁ e m ɑ̃ t i t j ɛ l
accrescent  a k ʁ ɛ s ɑ̃
accrétion   a k ʁ e s j ɔ̃
accrétions  a k ʁ e s j ɔ̃
```

By default, the scraped data appears in the terminal. To save the data in a TSV
file, please redirect the standard output to a filename of your choice:

```bash
wikipron fra > fra.tsv
```

#### Advanced Options

The `wikipron` terminal command has an array of options to configure your
scraping run. For a full list of the options, please run `wikipron -h`.

Python API
----------

The underlying module can also be used from Python. A standard workflow looks
like:

```python
import wikipron

config = wikipron.Config(key="fra")  # French, with default options.
for word, pron in wikipron.scrape(config):
    ...
```

Data
----

We also make available [a database of 2.5 million word/pronunciation
pairs](https://github.com/kylebgorman/wikipron/tree/master/data) mined using
WikiPron.

Models
------

We host grapheme-to-phoneme models and modeling software [in a separate
repository](https://github.com/kylebgorman/wikipron-modeling).

Development
-----------

### Repository

The source code of WikiPron is hosted on GitHub at
https://github.com/kylebgorman/wikipron, where development also happens.
